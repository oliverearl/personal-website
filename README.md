Since all GitHub users get a GitHub Pages subdomain to do whatever they like with, I've installed Jekyll using the GitHub Personal Page template onto it until such a time when I decide to do anything more with it. You can find more information about how it works and the general functionality of the template (and the SSG build process) in the Jekyll Markdown file, which was the original README document of this repository.

As you might've guessed, you can find my GH Pages website at [https://oliverearl.github.io](https://oliverearl.github.io)

## Where else?

- My main website can be found at [https://www.oliverearl.co.uk](https://www.oliverearl.co.uk).

- You can find my blog on [https://scratchpad.oliverearl.co.uk](https://scratchpad.oliverearl.co.uk).

## Roadmap

As above, not planning on changing this much until I come up with a better idea for this subdomain.
